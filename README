Steps to run:
1. *Optional step* if you want to extract Robust04's query 401-450 to compare with sigir'14 paper: use "extract401450" to extract queries 401~450: ./extract401450 new17.txt
2. Use "shuf.sh" to shuffle the dataset by queries for the cross validation step next.
3. Modify filename in CV.sh.
4. Run 3-fold cross validation: "./CV.sh".
5. *Optional step if you want to copy the results back to google drive spreadsheet easily*: Run "./google_doc.py" and copy results to google doc

Attention:
In non_dist.feature, feature "i" means our feature "i-1" because RankLib names feature as 1, 2, 3... but we name them as 0, 1, 2...

Datasets:
new15: 20170103
new16: 20170112 bigram distance 3
new17: 20170112 bigram distance 6

batch_* scripts are used for experiments with different L value(bigram distance) in the paper.
ep_* scripts(like ep_batch_CV.sh) are used for Enterprise2008 dataset.
aqt_* scripts(like aqt_batch_CV.sh) are used for AQUAINT dataset.
Default scripts(like batch_CV.sh) are used for Robust04 dataset.
